# HandyMath - HandsOn Math 

### Project description and write - up

HandyMath is a personal project that brings together two of my biggest interests: education and exploring new technologies. I’ve always enjoyed working on apps that make learning a more active, engaging process and I like to see how technology can turn a simple exercise into an experience that feels innovative and memorable.

HandyMath is a simple app that lets children practice mental math by answering questions only with their hands. Instead of tapping buttons or typing numbers, they just hold up their hand and show the answer with their fingers. For example, if the answer is three, the child shows three fingers to the camera, and the app instantly recognizes the gesture and checks if it’s correct. Everything works in real time, using only the device’s camera.

The app uses **Apple’s Vision framework** for real-time hand and finger tracking. By analyzing the camera feed, it detects the position of the joints on each finger to determine which fingers are up, allowing it to detect how many fingers a child is holding up and transform a simple hand gesture into a digital answer.

It transforms a normal learning activity into something touchless and intuitive. There are no buttons to tap or answers to type, so children simply hold up the number of fingers that matches the answer, and the app recognizes it instantly. I think that this is an elegant approach because it keeps things simple, natural, and focused on the practice itself, eventhough under the hood it’s using real-time computer vision and gesture recognition. I've always thought that through the use of this kind of technologies we can make something familiar to feel more magical. 

In general, even though the app still has a lot of room for improvement and currently only works with one hand, I believe it has a lot of potential. Right now, HandyMath supports only very simple answers from 1 to 5, but my main goal at this stage was to demonstrate the concept and the approach of using this technology for interactive learning. I see many possibilities for expanding its features and making it even more versatile in the future—like recognizing both hands or handling more complex answers. I look forward to continuing to develop the app and exploring new ways to enhance the experience.
